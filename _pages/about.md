Salvete omnes! 

I'm a Master's student at CU Boulder in the [CLASIC](https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/graduate-program/computational-linguistics-clasic-masters-degree) program, looking for summer internships in NLP Engineering in specific or machine learning in general.

I'm interested in making NLP tools accessible to the public, ranging from interactive systems for academic research to AI helpers for students. While my current projects involve building ML systems using PyTorch, TensorFlow, <strong>[or even NumPy](/projects/cnn)</strong>, my previous career in sales and marketing keeps me focused on the end user.

Previously, I was an Associate Manager at Johnson & Johnson in the Data Intelligence team. Extracting insights from messy sales data and designing dashboards to streamline communication informed my decision to pivot towards a data and engineering-centric career. Combined with my passion for linguistics (fluent in English, Mandarin, and French), designing NLP systems comes naturally to me.

Thanks for visiting my page, feel free to check out <strong>[my projects](/projects/)</strong> or contact me via email!
