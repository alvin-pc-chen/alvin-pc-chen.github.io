Hi, I'm Alvin, a recent graduate from the University of Colorado Boulder where I received my MS in Computational Linguistics and worked with both the [BLAST Group](https://blast-cu.github.io/) and the [CLEAR Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/). My work blends computational linguistics, machine learning, and data-centric engineering â€” from probing LLMs to developing AI tools for qualitative research.

Previously at Johnson & Johnson, I applied data intelligence to real-world business challenges, leading national-scale analytics, and campaign strategies. Now, I focus on neurosymbolic methods, causal interpretability, and building tools that improve human-AI interaction.

I am always happy to discuss my projects and areas of interest, feel free to [reach out](mailto:alvin.chen@colorado.edu)!
