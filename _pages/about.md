Salvete omnes! 

I'm a second year Master's student at CU Boulder in the <strong>[CLASIC](https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/graduate-program/computational-linguistics-clasic-masters-degree)</strong> program; most of my research is done with the <strong>[BLAST Group](https://blast-cu.github.io/)</strong> where I've been working on developing tools to support qualitative research.

I'm primarily interested in the intersection of NLP and HCI, specifically in terms of (1) researching human-in-the-loop methods that reliably incorporate expert knowledge, (2) developing interactive systems that facilitate human-AI teaming, and (3) evaluating the impact of these tools in tasks where ground truth is inaccessible. While I'm interested in exploring these interests across a broad range of qualitative data, my previous research has focused on social media datasets used in Computational Social Science.

Previously, I was an Associate Manager at Johnson & Johnson in the Data Intelligence team. Extracting insights from messy sales data and designing dashboards to streamline communication informed my decision to pivot towards a data and engineering-centric career. Combined with my passion for linguistics (fluent in English, Mandarin, and French), designing NLP systems comes naturally to me.

Here you'll find my <strong>[publications](/publications/)</strong> as well as my <strong>[projects](/projects/)</strong> which I use to familiarize myself with existing machine learning methods. 

Thanks for visiting my page, feel free to contact me via email, valete!
